## Welcome to Harsh's GitHub Site

Hey there, thanks for visiting my site powered by GitHub pages. I am a passionate coder who loves to automate mundane stuff and develop utilities and products for everyones convenience. Having worked on the Data Analytics stream at my full time job I behlod significant knowledge of Reporting, Visualization and Data Warehousing as well. Developed a few utilities in powershell, Pyhton and VB to automate the reporting process which was monotonus there.
